                            <p>PRESENTATION: Mondada, Con C치scara y Procesada</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The Chilean almond has a series of advantages compared to other producing countries: the fact of being located in the southern hemisphere, unlike the main world producers allows the Chilean almond industry to offer a fresher product for six months year. It suffers few pests, which implies an almond with a lower chemical load; the absence in laboratory analysis of aflatoxin, a fungus that affects almonds; and finally, the rich flavor of the Chilean almond, perhaps due to its climatic conditions.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The almond tree is a large deciduous fruit tree with a Mediterranean climate that survives in very difficult conditions, it is very tolerant to drought but not so much to cold. A characteristic of the almond tree is that it is not a self-pollinating tree: pollination is carried out by bees, which fly when the heat arrives and thus pollen is released properly. Flowering takes place in March, but the fruit has a ripening period of nine months.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">In Chile, almond plantations are concentrated in the central zone of the country, from Rancagua to the north.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>VARIEDAD: Extra Light / Light</p>
                            <p>PRESENTATION: Mariposa / Cuartos Trozos - Con c치scara / Sin c치scara</p>
                            <p>HARVEST: March - April</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The walnut is the fruit of the walnut, native to Persia and one of the oldest trees in the world (7000 BC). Currently, it is cultivated in temperate zones of Europe, Asia, Africa and the United States, especially in California, which is the world's largest producer.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The walnut is a product appreciated worldwide for its chemical composition, presenting high concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Its consumption improves vascular and coronary problems. Due to the multiple benefits it has for health and the fact that it is a natural, healthy and cholesterol-free snack, the worldwide demand is increasing.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The consumption of nuts is related to the coldest seasons of the year and religious holidays (mainly Christmas), being an ingredient in traditional dishes; although it is also consumed in jam or simply peeled.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The world production of walnuts is around one million tons. In the walnut business as a dried fruit there are two differentiated markets: the one for the walnut with the shell and the one for the walnut without the shell or split in two. Although it is the same fruit, each one has different characteristics, since its consumers demand different attributes of the product. Currently, more than 80% of the world's walnut production is sold shelled.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The Chilean walnut has an advantage over its competitors: the fact of being located in the southern hemisphere means that its product goes on the market when the harvests of the countries of the northern hemisphere are ending.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The chilean walnut is recognized as the best walnut in the world, thanks to its extralight color, its freshness and its matching yield, which make it a very attractive product.</p>

                            <p><b>SOURCE: Chile</b></p>
                            <br>
                            <p>VARIETY: Thompson / Crimson / Golden /Flame</p>
                            <p>SIZES: Jumbo 12mm / Medium 9-12mm</p>
                            <p>HARVEST: February y March</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The raisin is the dehydrated grape, and it is the fruit of the vine, a plant that can reach 100 years of age. It is typical of temperate zones, of low altitude and resistant to cold, but if it is exposed to temperatures below 2 degrees below zero after the appearance of the buds, the fruit can suffer serious damage.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">Raisins are dried fruits that have had much of the water removed, maintaining their nutritional value. The elaboration of the raisins begins with the selection and collection of the ripe grapes, which are taken to a dryer with the appropriate geographical and environmental conditions. The drying of raisins is carried out to a greater extent in the sun. Once the fruit is dry, it is washed with abundant water, thus eliminating impurities and foreign bodies. To finish its preparation, a vegetable oil is applied to the raisins that prevents them from caking.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">Raisins are rich in fiber, sodium, potassium and B vitamins, are a natural detoxifying and purifying food for the blood, and are an important source of energy since they contain a lot of sugar.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">In Chile, the harvest begins at the end of February, and there are generally stocks until October or November, depending on the harvest.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The most important varieties that we find in Chile are the Thompson, the Flame and the Crimson. There is also a kiln-dried variety, known for its blonde color, called Golden, which is another Thompson seedless variety. In addition, each of the varieties is calibrated by size, in large, medium and small.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The main raisin-producing countries are the United States, Turkey, China and Iran, out of a total of 12 producing countries, including Chile.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">Regarding world trade, Chile occupies an important place in the export of raisins, along with Turkey and the United States.</p>

                            <p>VARIETY: D'Agen</p>

                            <p>HARVEST: February y March</p>
                            <p>PRESENTATION: Con carozo y sin carozo</p>
                            <p class="text-center">Prunes are composed mainly of water, including a basic supply of minerals, vitamins and fibers. Prunes have more nutritional properties than fresh ones, since the drying process makes the natural components more concentrated.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">Prunes are the fruit with the most antioxidant power. It is very rich in potassium and fatty acids, which is why it is highly recommended in treatments against hypertension. Prunes contains five times more fiber than fresh plum, which makes it an effective remedy against constipation and intestinal regulation. It is also very useful for treating or preventing fluid retention, muscle problems, coughing, and bronchitis.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">Of all the varieties of plums grown in Chile, the most used for drying is the D'Agen variety due to its high sugar level.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">Traditionally in Chile, plum dehydration has been carried out in sun-dried fields, thanks to the climatic conditions of the area. However, there is also a significant amount of product that is dehydrated in tunnels, achieving faster and more controlled drying.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">The dehydrated product is later calibrated, selected and washed to start the tenderization process, a heat treatment that restores the moisture level. The fruits can be marketed pitted or with stone; if so, the seed is extracted by manual or mechanical systems.</p>
